Code Book run_analysis.R

#1.  features: contains the column names of training data
#2.  x_train: contains the training data 
#3.  after this step x_train column names are updeted by features data frame 
#4.  activity: contains the activity labels
#5.  y_train: contains the activity ids for the x_train data
#6.  y_train1: contains the activity ids and the activity description for the x_train data set.
#7.  x_train1: contains the data from x_train (step #2) plus the column with the activity description from 
	 y_train1 data frame 
#8.  x_train1: The new column name is set to "activity"
#9.  sub_train: contains the subject data corresponding to x_train and x_train1
#10. x_train2: contains the data from x_train1 (step #7) plus the column with the subject id from 
	 sub_train (step #9) data frame
#11. x_train2: The new column name is set to "subject"	 
#12. x_test: contains the training data
#13  after this step x_test column names are updeted by features data frame 
#14  y_test: contains the activity ids for the x_test data
#15  y_test1: contains the activity ids and the activity description for the x_test data set.
#16  x_test1: contains the data from x_test (step #14) plus the column with the activity description from 
	 y_test1 data frame 
#17  x_test1: The new column name is set to "activity"
#18  sub_test: contains the subject data corresponding to x_test and x_test1
#19  x_test2 :contains the data from x_test1 (step #17) plus the column with the subject id from 
	 sub_test (step #18) data frame
#20  x_test2 :The new column name is set to "subject"	
#21  activity, sub_test, sub_train, x_train, x_train1, y_train, y_train1, x_test, x_test1, y_test, y_test1: removed
#22  x_all:  contain all data from training nad test data frames
#23  x_test2, x_train2:  removed
#24  names1: contains the column names for x_all data frame
     listmean: contains the column names for the new data frame with mean 
#25  x_new : contains the columns of measurements on the mean and standard deviation
#26  x_all: removed
#27  tidy_set: data frame with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
